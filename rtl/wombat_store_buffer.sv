//============================================================================
//  wombat_store_buffer — ordered CPU write queue (four entries).
//
//  NeXT-Color copy (from MacQuadra800_MiSTer rtl/wombat_store_buffer.sv,
//  2026-09-26): the bufferable window is [POST_LO, POST_HI) instead of the
//  Quadra's RAM + DAFB VRAM, set by wombat_cpu (NeXT RAM + VRAM).
//
//  Only host-qualified, non-faulting physical RAM writes -- and writes into
//  the DAFB VRAM window, which is on-chip block RAM that can never fault --
//  may enter the queue. Their upstream acknowledgement is registered when
//  the transaction is captured; the writes then drain in order through the
//  ordinary bus. Non-qualified writes cannot pass an older queued write, so a
//  DAFB register write still sees every earlier pixel store landed; a read
//  may pass one queued write to another 16-byte line (see pass_ok below).
//
//  The queue sits below ap040_cache. Cache hits need no master transaction and
//  may therefore run while a write drains, which is the latency this block is
//  intended to hide. The host must keep buffer_writes low for ROM, devices, or
//  any region that can report a delayed bus error.

// stores to reach the SDRAM (about 5 % of the Speedometer bracket).  The
// drain of the head starts the cycle after its capture, so in practice
// the read passes the second of two queued stores once the first has
// landed.  A read of the queued store's own line still waits (a fill must
// see the store), non-qualified writes still wait, and a full queue always
// drains first, so a third store stalling the CPU is never starved by a
// stream of reads.
// Both transfers must sit inside one line for that compare to mean anything.
// The cache posts a store that straddles two lines UNSPLIT (a long at $xD-$xF,
// a word at $xF: 68k stacks are only word-aligned) and invalidates both lines,
// so the next read of the SECOND line is a fill that must see the store's
// tail; and a bypass read that straddles two lines must see a store queued
// to its second line.  Neither ever passes (2026-09-18; unit bench T5).
